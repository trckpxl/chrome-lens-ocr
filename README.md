**A lightweight, high-performance Rust library to use Google Lens OCR.**

This crate allows you to extract text from images using the Google Lens API used in Chromium. It functions without a headless browser, making it significantly faster and lighter than Puppeteer-based solutions.

## ✨ Features

* **Zero Headless Browser:** No need for Selenium, Puppeteer, or Playwright.
* **No Authentication:** Works without a Google account or API keys.
* **High Performance:** Direct API calls make it fast and efficient.
* **Rust Port:** A direct port of the Python library [chrome-lens-py](https://github.com/bropines/chrome-lens-py).
